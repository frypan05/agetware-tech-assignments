    "*In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.*\n",
    "*For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence*\n",
    "*Write code that implements encoding and decoding of a message.*\n",
    "*The parameters for the methods would be the message to be encoded / decoded and the length of the shift.*"
